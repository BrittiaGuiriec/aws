# Write an easy to learn framework for Node.js (suggested by Luca)

Node.js itself is too minimalistic, and not meant for beginners. Even if `connect` helps a lot, it still lacks some important features (setting cookies, help for routing, templates) that must be imported using other modules. On the other hand `express` is too complex for beginners.

Write a simplistic module extending `connect` and containing all the features needed in this course.


# Write a book on Node.js  (suggested by Luca)

[Node.js]() is verly poorly documented, especially in French and for beginners. Write a complete book for a beginner's course in Web Applications 2.0.
