# Write an easy to learn framework for Node.js (suggested by Luca)

This is done. See <https://github.com/defeo/was_framework>, or

# Write a book on Node.js  (suggested by Luca)

[Node.js]() is verly poorly documented, especially in French and for beginners. Write a complete book for a beginner's course in Web Applications 2.0.



# Platform agnostic course (suggested by Luca)

Here's a crazy idea. Make classes independent from the platform ([Node.js](), [PHP](), etc.), and leave to the students the choice of the platform they will use in tutorials. For the moment, Tutorials written for [Node.js]() and [PHP]() are already written. What about adding JEE Servlets?



# Code in the cloud

Use Cloud9 <https://c9.io> for in-class development. The only difficult point, is to have reliable internet connection throughout the whole tutorial... impossible to do on wi-fi, but most likely doable with ethernet cables.
