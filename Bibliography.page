The bibliography on web programming is overblown. The Science Library shelves crack under the weight of redundant and obsolescent literature on the subject.

To deepen your understanding of [PHP](), [Javascript](), etc., you can basically take any book from the library and quickly read through. Avoid old books, though: check the the first edition (not the last) hasn't been written more than five years ago, as much of these subjects tend to change quickly.

Here is a small selection of books that may be more useful than the average one.
