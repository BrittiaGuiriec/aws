title: Web Applications and Security
...

The times when the web used to be a mere collection of "documents" are long gone. SGML and HTML frames are things of the past, and Flash may become soon. Nowadays, the web developer 2.0 speaks dozens of domain specific languages -[ECMAScript](), [HTML5](HTML), [CSS](), [SVG](), [XML](), [JSON](), [Perl](), [PHP](), [Python](), [SQL](), ...- and constantly preaches for [AJAX]().

To succeed in this fast paced domain, the IT professional must possess many diverse skills. She must fully understand the way data are exchanged between the components of the application, she must know a large palette of languages and tools and constantly keep up to date, and finally she must understand what are the critical entry points of her application and how to secure them from external attackers.

This course aims at giving the bases of modern dynamic web programming, with a spin on attack techniques and security analysis.

# Bibliography

The bibliography on web programming is overblown. The Science Library
shelves crack under the weight of redundant and obsolescent literature
on the subject.

To deepen your understanding of [PHP](), [Javascript](), etc., you can
basically take any book from the library and quickly read
through. Avoid old books, though: check that the first edition (not
the last) hasn't been written more than, say, five years ago.

Here is a small selection of links and books that may be more useful
than the average one.

    005.8 CAN. Badly written, translated even worse, and essentially
    an advertisement booklet for the authors' company. Nevertheless,
    it is one of the few books on the security of web apps available
    at the library. It is divided in four parts, each ending with a
    case study. Part I is extremely interesting, so be sure to read
    it. Part II talks about [CSRF](), so read at least the first
    chapter and the case study.
