Some exercises require invoking the [PHP]() command line interpreter, like this:

    php hello.php

If you work under Windows with an installed solution stack (e.g. [XAMPP]()), some additional steps are needed to run this command.

1. Open a terminal
2. Find your install of [PHP](). This will depend on your solution stack, see below.
3. Descend into the [PHP]() install and run `php.exe` followed by the name of the program.

Here's an example of what a session might look like

~~~
C:\Users\Luca> cd C:/xampp/php
C:\xammp\php> php C:/Users/Luca/hello.php
~~~

## Where is the PHP install?

This depends on the solution stack you installed. Here's a list of the most common ones:

XAMMP
:   Go under `C:\xampp\php`. The executable is named `php.exe`.
