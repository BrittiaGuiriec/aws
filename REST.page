REST stands for Representational State Transfer. A REST API is one that conforms to certain constraints, very similar to the constraints of the [HTTP]() protocol.

REST service constraints

A REST service must be:

Client-Server
:   Which excludes peer-to-peer prtocols.
Stateless 
:   Which excludes CORBA, and other RPC protocols.
Cacheable
:   
Layered
:   Meaning that it is compatible with the use of proxies.
Have a uniform Interface
:   By implenting a well defined set of verbs (for example GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).
(Optional) Scriptable
:   e.g. [JavaScript]()


# REST Verbs

REST APIs are composed of a set of verbs, usually `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

**Idempotent** verbs are verbs such that two successive calls to them yield the same result. In other words, idempotent verbs do not modify the server state.
