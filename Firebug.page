# FirePHP

FirePHP is a logging facility and debugging system for [PHP](). It is made up of two components: a Firefox extension working together with Firebug, and a PHP script to be invoked on the server.

It works by including debugging data in the [HTTP]() headers of the server response, then by showing them in the Firebug console on the client side.

The software and the documentation are available at <http://www.firephp.org/>.
