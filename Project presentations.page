# Project submission

Send the following items to the [instructor](http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/~dfl) by e-mail **before Saturday May 12, 23:59 CEST**. If you are late fixing a bug, the best choice is to send what you've done till the deadline, then try to fix the bug in time for the presentation.

**Source code:**

- All the source files: PHP, HTML, JavaScript, etc.
- An export of the database (at least what is needed to run the project),
- A readme file with instructions to install and run the project,
- Any other file needed to successfully run the project,
- No platform specific files, No compiled files, though a Unix shell script to help me install complicated projects will be appreciated.

**Project summary:**

- Written in French or English,
- Encoded in an open format (open document, pdf, etc.),
- Max 2000 words: one or two pages is the best,
- Describe what your project does, how you organized your work, what programming techniques you employed, what difficulties you faced. Include a reflection on its security.


# The defense

The project defenses will comprise 15 minutes of presentation followed by 10 minutes of questions. Balance your presentation between the following topics:

- A live demonstration of the project and its features,
- A discussion on the coding techniques you employed, eventually showing code excerpts.

There will be a projector in the room, **bring your own laptop** for the presentation. Internet connectivity might be unavailable, especially in room G002, so be prepared to run the project demonstration locally on your machine. If you wish, you can use a slideshow to support your presentation.


# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the project defenses. Book a time slot by writing next to it:

- Your names;
- The title of your project;
- If you have published your project online, a link to it.

Should any conflicts arise, try to solve them on the [discussion page](/_discuss/Project presentation) first.
