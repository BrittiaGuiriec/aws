# Web Applications and Security

**Instructor:** Luca De Feo <http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/~dfl>

**Course wiki:** <http://swift.prism.uvsq.fr/>. Read it, use it, ask questions, contribute to it!

**Language:** English is **the only** language of the web. Course material will be in English, please write in English on the wiki.

**Course structure:** 12 lessons, first half web programming, second half security.

**Final project:** Work in pairs. Dynamic web application (e.g. online multiplayer game) + short description (max. 5 pages).



# Practical matters

**Classes:** come with your laptop if you wish.

**Tutorials:** (TDs) you will need a laptop. Coming with yours is (by far!) the preferred way.

If you don't have one, you can borrow it from the UFR: go and see [Fabienne Chevalier](http://applis.uvsq.fr/AnnuairePersonnel/FicheEmploye?CN=20621-110-0) at least 15 mins before the tutorial.

**Administering your software environment:** You will need *a lot* of software! Free at least 1GB (2GB is better) on your disk.

I have prepared some standard, minimalist, software configurations, but you are strongly encouraged to set up your own environment.



# Read the wiki

All the course material (classes, tutorials and more) will be on the wiki.

To stay tuned, **add the ATOM feed** <http://swift.prism.uvsq/_feed> to your favorite aggregator. If you don't know what a feed aggregator is, search the web.

**Use the wiki** to discuss your installation problems with others. To get started, read [How to use the wiki]().
