To edit a page click on the **edit** tab above. To create a new page,
simply type its address in the address bar of your browser.

In the editor, the wiki syntax is shown on the right. This should be
enough for a simple page, but if you want more you can also read the
[Pandoc documentation](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html).

Add the [feed](/_feed) to your favorite aggregator to keep up with
changes on the wiki.
