URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a string uniquely
identifying a resource on the internet. Familiar URLs are
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax>, <ftp://ftp.fr.debian.org/>,

The quick development of the WWW pushed the IETF to standardize it in
1994.

# Syntax

The general syntax is

    scheme://username:password@domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id

# URL encoding

An URL cannot contain certain characters (spaces, for example). To
encode those characters, an UTF coding is used instead: the character is
coded as a percent sign `%` followed by its hexadecimal code. For
example, space is encoded as `%20`.
